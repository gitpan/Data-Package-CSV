NAME
    Data::Package::CSV - A Data::Package class for CSV data using Parse::CSV

DESCRIPTION
    The Data::Package::CSV package provides a subclass of
    Data::Package::File that provides data from a CSV file by integrating
    with Parse::CSV.

METHODS
  csv_options
    The cvs_options method is the most direct method, with full control over
    the creation of the Parse::CSV object. If a fully compliant options hash
    is returned (as a list) then no other methods need to be defined.

    The list returned by the cvs_options method will be passed directly to
    the Parse::CSV constructor. Read the documentation for Parse::CSV for
    more details on what you should return to match your data.

    By default, the null list is return, specifying entirely default options
    to the Parse::CSV constructor (array mode) and not specifying any
    filters or parsing variations.

    If it list that is returned does not have either a data source (either a
    "handle" param or "file" param) then the "file" method for the parent
    class will be called to locate a file.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker.
